            <p className="light">We must work together with elected officials, faith based community, non profits, and the police department to make sure we are doing all that we can to make our community safe. I have experience working with our stakeholders and I will use that experience to make sure we come up with a plan now, to make our community safe.</p>

            <p className="light">There is work to be done and I have the experience working with the community and government agencies to ensure that we are not only providing funding to house our homeless, but also to prevent homelessness.</p>

            <h5 className="center">INCREASE JOB MARKET</h5>

            <p className="light">During my time as a city planning commissioner, I welcomed new businesses into our city. New businesses provide new opportunities for employment to Santa Ana residents. Conversely, we must also connect current businesses to the resources they need to continue to thrive.</p>

            <p className="light">I have been on the front lines of this battle, working tirelessly with community members and landlords to find new and creative ways to come to mutually beneficial terms. I know how it feels to lose a home, and I know how costly it can be for all parties involved.</p>

            <p className="light">The community has spoken, and it has spoken loud and clear. Improved 911 response times is a high priority. I will take the lead in finding the root cause of our less than acceptable response times. Whether we are understaffed or undertrained, I'm confident that there is a solution.</p>

            <p className="light">Witnessing my mother's volunteer work and countless altruistic efforts throughout my life has had a direct influence on my passion for serving my community. I have litterally made a career out of it working full time at a non profit as a Victim Assistance Specialist.</p>
