            <p>My name is Beatriz Mendoza.  I grew up in Santa Ana.  I am a daughter of an immigrant mother.  My father passed when I was three years old.  My life has not been easy and my mother who I love dearly did the best she could.</p>

            <p>Affordable housing was always an issue for us.  Growing up my mother had to rent out rooms in order to make ends meet.  Needless to say, we moved quite a bit and my mother worked multiple jobs to put food on the table.  As a young girl, I remember walking to and from school with my siblings. My mother could not take us as she had to leave to work on the bus. After, she would come home and cook for us before she went to her second job.  This meant that I was alone a lot and it wasn’t long before I experienced sexual abuse.  I became a single mom at 19 and all the odds were stacked against me but I knew that I needed to not only provide for my son but be a positive example as well.</p>

            <p>I made a choice to attend Orange Coast College.  It was tough balancing work, being a mother and going to class but it wasn’t long before I was accepted to UCLA.  I was the first to graduate from college in my family in 2008.</p>

            <p>This story is not unique in our community.  We have a very hardworking community that wants a better life for their children.  Our schools have stepped up and now it is time that our city leaders do the same.  I have worked for a State Senator, a member of the U.S. Congress and I currently work as an advocate and Victim Assistance Specialist for Zero Abuse Project, a non profit organization committed to ending child abuse. </p>

            <p>Today, special interest is investing a tremendous amount of money in our city elections.  I want to stand against special interest.  I understand our difficulties and what we need to do in our city to improve our quality of life.</p>

            <p>This November lets work together to bring Santa Ana to new heights.  I respectfully ask for your vote.  Beatriz Mendoza for Santa Ana City Council Ward 4.</p>
